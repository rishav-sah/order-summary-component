## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow using Media Queries

### What I learned

The major learning which I learned through this project is to implement CSS variables for different colors and to write meaningful class names using BEM(Block Element Modifier) methodology.

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

In future I'll be building this project using React Js Components.

### Useful resources

- [BEM (Block, Element, Modifier)](https://en.bem.info/methodology/quick-start/) - This helped me learn about BEM. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [CSS variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand CSS variables and its uses. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
